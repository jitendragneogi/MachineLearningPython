# MachineLearningPython
A true project in advanced Machine Learning journey from University of Washington offered by Coursera

Python can be used to run some very interesting Machine Learning algorithms. If you are already taking or have taken the Emily Fox & Carlos Guestrin - Machine Learning Specialization course offered by University of Washington through Coursera, you are probably familiar with the problems I uploaded in this branch. I kept this here in github as I might want to refer to these codes in my Capstone project that I am planning to do around April, 2017 on Machine Learning.

Thanks, Jitendra
